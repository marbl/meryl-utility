Various notes that should be turned into real documentation

merStream
        (need to check this)
        posInSeq() is relative to the start of the current sequence.
        posInStream() is relative to the start of the source file.

Whitespace in the sequence / source files mess up position calculations.

The FastAstream positions are NOT sequence positions.
